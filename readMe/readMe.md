# How to use this website

Short information please use VScode because this tutorial is specified on VScode

1. If you don't have dowloaded node, you can do that on the official node website
2. After you have installed node you can run the command: npm install
3. After the last step you can finally open the project by running this command: node index.js
4. After that go on the localhost: 3001 and make an account and after that you can use the website

If the code isn't running there could be an error with the localhost you can change that in the index.js file under this code:

app.listen(3001, function () {
    console.log("Server started on port 3001");
});

just change the 3001 with another number save it and then restart it
